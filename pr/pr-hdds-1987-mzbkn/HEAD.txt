    Fix a bug uncovered by testListStatusOnLargeDirectory:
    startKey is incorrectly assigned inside listStatus that causes an infinite loop in BasicOzoneFileSystem#listStatus when requested&actual number of entries >= LISTING_PAGE_SIZE. The root cause is that startKey will always stay the same value after the second while loop, statuses will be infinitely populated and cause GC.
    
    Solution: Move the startKey append back to its original position and deal with the special case in startCacheKey.
