    Added the DatanodeAdminMonitor class to allow nodes to be tracked and moved through the decommission workflow.
    
    With this commit, a node can be added to the monitor for decommission or maintenace and it will have its pipelines closed.
    
    It will not make any further progress after the pipelines have been closed and further commits will address the next states.
